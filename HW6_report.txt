In this homework we explored how C variables and structs are laid out in memory and how alignment rules affect addresses and total size. First we observed alignment of basic data types and saw that larger types tend to align on stricter boundaries. Then we analyzed struct padding and demonstrated how reordering fields or using #pragma pack changes the memory layout and overall size by reducing or increasing implicit padding.
